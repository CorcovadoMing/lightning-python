Lightning: interactive data visualization 
=========================================

Lightning is a notebook server for producing and sharing interactive visualizations. This is the documentation for its Python client, which makes it easy to generate interactive visualizations from Python, including from within an iPython notebook. Visualizations are rendered in javascript, and use both d3.js (for two-dimensional charts) and three.js (for three-dimensional visualizations).
